    <p>After your first bite, you won’t want to make another cheesecake recipe.<br>
         This blueberry cheesecake recipe is rich and creamy, with pops of sweet blueberry throughout and on top.<br> 
         The silky smooth cream cheese filling pairs so wonderfully with the crunchy,<br>
          buttery graham cracker crust that you’ll want to make this recipe over and over.</p>

           <li> 1Butter — you’ll need unsalted butter as you do not want a salty base for your cheesecake. <br>
            </li>
            
            <li>2Cream cheese — I recommend using full-fat cream cheese for the best flavor.<br>
             Do not buy the spreadable type from a tub. Cold cream cheese will lead to
            a lumpy batter so always bring the cream cheese to room temperature before using it.<br>
            </li>
            
            <li>3Sour cream — you won’t believe how much more soft, moist, and tender the blueberry cheesecake filling 
                is when you add full-fat sour cream to the batter.
             You also get a nice tangy flavor to the cheesecake.
              If you forgot to pick some sour cream up, try making my homemade sour cream with only three ingredients. <br>
            </li>
            
            <li>4Eggs — eggs help make the filling smooth and give it a rich texture. Do not forget the eggs.<br>
                </li>
            
            <li>5Blueberries — I prefer to use fresh blueberries but if using frozen blueberries for the cheesecake,
             then do not thaw, or the color will bleed into the batter as you mix it.<br></li>
            
            <li>6Lemon juice — I highly recommend using fresh lemon juice as it tastes brighter and more flavorful.
             After all the work you put into this cheesecake, 
             you don’t want to finish it with bottled lemon juice that has an aftertaste.<br></li>

<h2><!--and by using the h3 we will type the method--> </h2> 
<div><p> METHOD 
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar.<br>
2. Press the mixture into the bottom of a greased 9-inch springform pan and about 2-inches up sides of the prepared pan.<br> Refrigerate while preparing the filling, or at least 30 minutes<br>
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy.<br>
4. Add the sour cream and beat on medium speed until combined, about 1 minute. Add the eggs, one at a time,<br> beating well after each addition. Mix in the flour and vanilla until smooth.<br>
5. Gently fold in the blueberries. Pour the batter into the chilled crust, spreading the top into an even layer.<br>
   Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, with a casserole dish of hot water in the bottom rack of the oven which acts as a water bath.<br>
   Tent with foil if the top starts to brown during baking. Let cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. <br>
   Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 4 and up to 24 hours.<br>
6. In a small saucepan, bring 1 ½ cups of blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice to a simmer over medium heat.<br>
7. Cook until the blueberries break down and the sauce is syrupy. In a small bowl, whisk together the water and cornstarch.<br>
 Stir it into the pan along with the remaining 1/2 cup of blueberries, and cook until thickened. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.<br>

8. Spoon the blueberry topping over the cooled blueberry cheesecake before slicing.<br>
